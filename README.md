# Tabwise: Vertical Tabs & Workspaces

If your browser looks like this right now:
- 47 tabs open
- 6 GitHub tabs
- 3 Figma files
- 4 Gmail instances (why??)

…**Tabwise is for you.**

Tabwise brings Arc Browser's vertical tab experience to Chrome, Brave, Edge, and AI browsers like Comet, Atlas, and Dia: a clean side panel with Favorites, Workspaces, Smart Tab Switching, and true Immersive Browsing.

## The Problem

Horizontal tabs don't scale. After 10–15 tabs:
- You can't read tab titles (favicon roulette begins)
- You open duplicates by accident
- Context switching between work/personal/projects becomes chaos
- Browser chrome is always visible—no escape from the clutter

Bookmarks don't help either—they always open a new tab instead of focusing the existing one.

---

## The Solution: Tabwise

A vertical tab manager that behaves like a workspace—with the option to disappear completely when you need to focus.

---

## Key Features

### Smart Tab Switching (no more duplicates)

Click Gmail → Tabwise focuses your existing Gmail tab.
Click again → stays on that tab. Not a new one.
No more "Gmail tab #5" situation.

`Shift+Click` = force open a new tab when you actually want a second instance.

### Favorites Grid (Arc-style)

Your most-used sites in a clean 4-column favicon grid.
- One-click access to daily tools
- Visual indicators when a site is already open
- Drag to reorder

### Workspaces (collapsible context groups)

Create workspaces like:
- **Work** → Slack, dashboard, docs, email
- **Client A** → portal, reports, tickets
- **Personal** → social, finance, shopping

Collapse what you're not using. Switch contexts with one click.

### Quick Search (keyboard-first)

Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` to search across:
- Favorites
- Workspace items
- Open tabs
- Recent history (last 24 hours)

Press Enter to jump instantly. Never hunt for tabs again.

### Immersive Browsing Mode

Toggle the sidebar with `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + E`.
Hide Chrome's tab bar.
Result: **ZERO browser chrome visible.**

True full-screen, app-like web experience. Tabs appear only when you summon them. No browser offers this out of the box.

### One-click Tab Grouping

Overwhelmed with 7 GitHub tabs and 5 Figma tabs?
One click groups all tabs by domain. Collapse groups. Close all at once.

Smart handling for Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides—each gets its own group.

### Screenshot Capture

Select any region of any page.
Copy to clipboard or download as PNG.
Built-in—no extra extension needed.
